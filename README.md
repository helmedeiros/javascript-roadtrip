| -------- | :--------------: | :-----: | ----:  |
| +        |	Addition        |	3 + 2   |	5      |
| -        |	Subtraction     |	3 - 2   |	1      |
| *        |	Multiplication  |	3 * 2   |	6      |
| /        |	Division        |	3 / 2   |	1.5    |
| %        |	Modulus         |	3 % 2   |	1      |
